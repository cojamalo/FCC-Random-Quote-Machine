# FCC-Random-Quote-Machine

This is the repository for my completion of the FreeCodeCamp Build a Random Quote Machine project. Formatted for mobile use.

A working version is at http://codepen.io/cojamalo/pen/wzJLpk.


The project is an example of a simple AJAX request to Reddit.com. Retrieves data in JSON format and processes to display reddit thumbnails and to create clickable image links to original post of the image. Also features HTML form with search box and submit button.
